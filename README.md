REST api for a simple git repo

### Get Started

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/zillding/git-repo-server.git

```

Open `http://localhost:1337` to see the results.

### Development

All source code is in the `lib` dir. The web app related code is in `lib/app`.

The web app is written in react and at development time simply run:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` to see a react-transform enabled version of the web
app.

```bash
$ npm run build
```
